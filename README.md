# OX2R Lead Descovery

Code and report corresponding to the final project of the Computational Structural Biology for Lead Discovery course (MSc in Computational Biology-UPM).

## Abstract

The aim of this project was to create a computational pipeline for the identification of targets for **Orexin type 2 receptor - OX2R**, which is a protein that regulates various physiological functions, including sleep-wake cycles, arousal, appetite, and stress responses. This targets are explored as drug candidates to treat insomnia.

The lead discovery pipeline proposed in this work is divided in 5 modules: 

1. OX2R structural analysis
2. Ligand based virtual screening (LBVS)
3. ADMET Properties Validation
4. Pharamcophore based virtual screening (PBVS)
5. Protein Ligand Docking
